A digital battlemap with pasazz. A little bit of a beast to learn, requires a relatively high resolution display but might be suitable for online play.

## Portable projector?
I own a small portable projector which I bought for some Clone Hero shenanningans, I've used it with a raspberry pi running FoFiX but only like once. Projecting movies in a cabin has been nice but can I use it for a portable digital battlemap for more complex locations like castle Ravenloft? With planarally that seemed possible but FoundryVTT requires higher resolution than this projector is capabable of. So the answer is a clear **NO**.

## Why this post?
This post was mainly written to try out the categories off the theme.

## Current thoughts
Setting up battlemaps takes time with the walls and all. There's some nice draw on the fly modules available. For Ravenloft and next halloween I'll put in the time. For other campaigns I can see some benefit. Like jungle exploration would be really nice.

But mostly I'm thinking about theater of the mind moments. There's some nice animated artwork for Curse of Strahd locations that could make really nice backgrounds.

Notes seem like a nice thing too. Adding books with text bits that the players can pick up and read through between sessions.
