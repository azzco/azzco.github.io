I'd like to set upp a nice environment to make blog posts more easily. Preview with `bundle exec jekyll serve --preview` and upload with git.

## Neovim
I'd like to get into vim a bit more. Right now I'm writing in visual studio code. It works but I'd like to keep it simple. Right now I'm not sure how to create a simple file easily. Sure I can open a skeleton file and save under a different filename but there has to be an easier way to genereate a skeleton file at a new destination.

## Dotfiles
I should really start getting dotfiles up on github for all my needs. I'm switching between my normal computer, laptop and workcomputer as it is.
