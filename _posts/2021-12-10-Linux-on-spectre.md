title: Linux on my Spectre
category: blog
---
I've had this laptop for five months now and I'm starting to miss linux, time to change that.

# WSL
Windows subsystem for linux, sure I can get some things running through that but it doesn't feel like 'home'. On my stationary I have some nice keybinds for switching desktops, bringing in a quake-style terminal and whatnot. I can't bring in yakuake with WSL, the terminal is slow (jeez bring me a couple of symbols already) and running vim through windows powershell feels more like a hack than anything.

In short WSL feels quite detached from the desktop.

# Dual boot
I plan to dualboot manjaro, I'm afraid of loosing some files but it's a risk I'm willing to take. I've learned to not grow too attached to locally stored files by this point. I'm not sure how file management is these days on the windows partition but it can't be that bad right?

# Office
I do have a windows office 365 subscription, I barely use it and I'm leaning more towards open source solutions anyway. Excel is the exception, I use it in work quite a bit and I'm familiar with it. I've heard good things about **R** But it's not something I've delved into just yet.

# Compatibility
This computer has some nice features, some nice features which helped me in making the decision before buying. Little bit of a dealbreaker if these things won't work:
* Touch screen
* Pressure sensitive pen
* Power management
* Rotating screen
* Bluetooth
* Wi-fi
* Fingerprint
* 3d acceleration

The keyboard layout is quite bad to be honestly but it's nothing that the OS can do something about. Maybe remapping some keys wouldn't hurt and I know that I can do that.

# Some setup I need to take care of
There's a couple of things I do need to start doing routinely:
* Manage dotfiles
* Get more comfortable with git
* Clean up google drive

# Software
Some software I should really be ready to setup:
* Neovim
* Joplin
* Blender
* Krita
* Jekyll
