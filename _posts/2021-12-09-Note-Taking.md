Efficient notes during studies, thoughts.

# Studies
I think I'll take physics and will need to be able to create diagrams, plot-graphs and writing mathematical formulas. Writing formulas is relatively simple with latex entries. Plots, graphs on the other hand is whole different beast.

Unfortunately github flavoured markdown does not support latex as far as I'm aware. Let's give it a whirl just to see:
$$
\frac{\infty_2}{\pi^3}
$$

Otherwise markdown seems like a really nice approach with a good outline, joplin might actually be really suited for the task. There's some extra functionality it can provide. If I want to render PDFs with the eisvogel template for assignments or whatnot that's not very hard.

## R Markdown
So I just glanced over a Luke Smith video on R Markdown and it seems to have some benefits. You can run arbitrary code right inside the document that will be rendered for output, formatting seems quite nice by default, latex and tikz seems to be working pretty straightforward.

Using R-studio seems like a way to go but maybe not what I want. I'd really love to get into vim honestly. Getting away from visual studio code and the weird keybinds I don't want to mess around with would be ideal but the extensions, live previews and whatnot are really lovely. especially for math formulas!
