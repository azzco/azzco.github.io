Efficient notes during studies, thoughts.

# Studies
I think I'll take physics and will need to be able to create diagrams, plotgraphs and writing mathematical formulas. Writing formulas is relatively simple with latex entries. Plots, graphs on the other hand is whole different beast.

Unfortunately github flavoured markdown does not support latex as far as I'm aware. Let's give it a whirl just to see:
$$
\frac{\infty_2}{\pi^3}
$$

Otherwise markdown seems like a really nice approach with a good outline, jopling might actually be really suited for the task. There's some extra functionality it can provide. If I want to render PDFs with the eisvogel template for assignments or whatnot that's not very hard.
