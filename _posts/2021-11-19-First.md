Unsure if this is even working yet I'm already thinking about the next steps.

## Is this working?
So I've spent most of the evening getting this website up. Just getting a website up on github was easy enough but not enough. I *needed* something fancier that suits me. The theme minimal-mistakes had some nice features and actually some nice colour variations to chose from. At the time of writing I'm still not sure if this will work but I have to begin somewhere.

## Things to add
At the moment I know a few things I want added:
- [ ] Link to planarally
- [ ] Link to separate d&d blog for campaign journaling.
	
	I would very much like separate "categories" for different campaigns.
- [ ]
