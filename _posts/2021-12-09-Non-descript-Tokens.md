# Creating tokens
Non specific 3d printed tokens for TTRPG use.
I intend to create them as follows:
* Print with a wood pla
* Sandpaper with a coarse paper.
* Lightly stain
* Sandpaper with a medium paper.
* Lightly stain
* Sandpaper with a fine paper
* Lightly stain
* Fill in the depressed parts with epoxy mixed with colours.
* Add a finishing protective layer.
* Give away to my DM. ðŸ˜€

# Thoughts
The stain I have at home is fairly dark in colour with some hints of red. Will contrast paint be able to distinguish the two sets from one another? Am I better off just going with the resin printer and painting them?
