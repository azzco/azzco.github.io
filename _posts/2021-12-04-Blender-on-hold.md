Blender is a powerhouse, there's much in store for 3.0, I'm holding off for now.

## What I've been up too
I've done some 3d modeling of maps for D&D in tabletop simulator. I've also done some models that I've printed for physical D&D play. Other than that I haven't actually done much more than mess around.

## What I want to do
I want to create some nice looking background pictures for our session summaries. Sketching up a quick environment like a cave crossing or something, add some of the previous models and go over it with grease pencil to produce some watercolor like work.

Some features that Blender 3.0 provides that I think I could make use off:
* Asset browser
    Why reinvent the wheel when I can just duplicate further on? Making small modular assets and bringing them into the scene seems like a nice idea and building a library over time, not digging through old blend files seems hugely benificial.
* Cycles X
    Faster render times, that's it. I need to get more into lighting and faster raytracing can not be helpfull on that front.

Other than that I don't really know what's in store but taking another plunge at this point seems a little bit stupid honestly.
